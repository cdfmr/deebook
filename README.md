# DeeBook

DeeBook is a universal IE based ebook decompiler.

# Compile

Developed with Visual C++ 6.0, should be upgraded to later versions of Visual Studio with minor modification.

# Usage

Open ebook, locate its content area with DeeBook, then click "Decompile" button. Of course, you can adjust some settings before decompiling.

# Limitation

All images are captured from screen directly, so there are some limitations.

* Can not save images with transparent background.

* Can not save animated GIF images.

* It's better to maxmize ebook window to ensure images can be captured without being cropped.
